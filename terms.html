      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="mb-4">These terms govern your use of the Razzlab platform. By accessing or using Razzlab, you agree to be bound by these terms. Razzlab is a membership‑based platform for collectors to run peer‑to‑peer razzes (raffles) of trading cards. Participation in razzes is available to registered members only, and all draws are conducted fairly using cryptographic randomness.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Membership</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">You must create an account and become a member to participate in razzes. By signing up, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old and reside in a jurisdiction where participation in peer‑to‑peer raffles is legal.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conduct of Razzes</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">All razzes are created by sellers in good faith. Sellers are responsible for delivering the advertised card to the winner. Razzlab provides the platform but does not take possession of items. Razzes may include smaller “Mini Razzes” that feed winners into a main draw.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Fairness and Randomness</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Winners of razzes are chosen using `crypto.getRandomValues()` in the client or other cryptographically secure random methods. The process is logged to provide transparency and assurance to participants.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Fees</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Razzlab may charge a small fee to cover platform costs. Details are outlined in our <a href="fee-policy.html" class="text-purple-600 underline">Fee Policy</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Liability</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Razzlab is not responsible for the actions of individual sellers or buyers. While we strive to maintain a trustworthy community, all transactions occur directly between members. In the event of a dispute, please contact us and we will assist in resolving the issue where possible.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of the platform after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
